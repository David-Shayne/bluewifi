      <h2>Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”) specifies the actions prohibited to
        users of the network and systems (“infrastructure”) of Blue Wifi (Pty)
        Ltd (“Blue Wifi”) and its subsidiaries. Users are required to adhere to
        this policy without exception. The terms “User”, “Subscriber” and
        “Customer” are used interchangeably.{' '}
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>1. LAWS AND REGULATIONS</h2>
      <p>
        1.1. Blue Wifi’s infrastructure may be used only for lawful purposes.
        Users may not violate any applicable laws or regulations of South Africa
        within the territory of South Africa. Should the user reside outside of
        South Africa, the laws of the country in which the user resides shall
        apply. 1.2. Transmission, distribution or storage of any material on or
        through the infrastructure in violation of any applicable law or
        regulation is prohibited. This includes, without limitation, material
        protected by copyright, trademark, trade secrets or other intellectual
        property right used without proper authorisation, and material that is
        obscene, defamatory, constitutes an illegal threat, or violates export
        control laws.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>2. THE NETWORK</h2>
      <p>
        2.1. The user acknowledges that Blue Wifi is unable to exercise control
        over the content of the information passing over the infrastructure and
        the Internet, including any websites, electronic mail transmissions,
        news groups or other material created or accessible over its
        infrastructure. Therefore, Blue Wifi is not responsible for the content
        of any messages or other information transmitted over its
        infrastructure. 2.2. Blue Wifi’s infrastructure may be used to link into
        other networks worldwide and the user agrees to conform to the
        acceptable use policies of these networks. 2.3. The user may obtain and
        download any materials marked as available for download off the Internet
        but is not permitted to use its Internet access to distribute any
        copyrighted materials unless permission for such distribution is granted
        to the user by the owner of the materials. 2.4. The user is prohibited
        from obtaining and/or disseminating any unlawful materials, including
        but not limited to stolen intellectual property, child pornography,
        and/or any unlawful hate-speech materials.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>3. SYSTEM AND NETWORK SECURITY</h2>
      <p>
        3.1. All references to systems and networks under this section includes
        the Internet (and all those systems and/or networks to which user is
        granted access through Blue Wifi ) and includes but is not limited to
        the infrastructure of Blue Wifi itself. 3.2. The user may not circumvent
        user authentication or security of any host, network, or account
        (referred to as “cracking” or “hacking”), nor interfere with service to
        any user, host, or network (referred to as “denial of service attacks”).
        3.3. Violations of system or network security by the user are
        prohibited, and may result in civil or criminal liability. Blue Wifi
        will investigate incidents involving such violations and will involve
        and will co-operate with law enforcement officials if a criminal
        violation is suspected. Examples of system or network security
        violations include, without limitation, the following: 3.3.1.
        Unauthorised access to or use of data, systems or networks, including
        any attempt to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of any system or
        network or to breach security or authentication measures without the
        express authorisation of Blue Wifi . 3.3.2. Unauthorised monitoring of
        data or traffic on the network or systems without express authorisation
        of Blue Wifi 3.3.3. Interference with service to any user, host or
        network including, without limitation, mail bombing, flooding,
        deliberate attempts to overload a system and broadcast attacks. 3.3.4.
        Forging of any TCP-IP packet header (spoofing) or any part of the header
        information in an email or a newsgroup posting.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>4. FAIR ACCESS POLICY</h2>
      <p>
        4.1. To help ensure that all users have fair and equal use of the
        service and to protect the integrity of the network, Blue Wifi reserves
        the right, and will take necessary steps, to prevent improper or
        excessive usage thereof, the action that Blue Wifi may take includes,
        but is not limited to: 4.1.1. Limiting throughput 4.1.2. Preventing or
        limiting service through specific ports or communication protocols;
        and/or 4.1.3. Complete termination of service to users who grossly abuse
        the network through improper or excessive usage. 4.2. This policy
        applies to and will be enforced for intended and unintended (e.g.,
        viruses, worms, malicious code, or otherwise unknown causes) prohibited
        usage. 4.3. Online activity will be subject to the available bandwidth,
        data storage and other limitations of the service provided, which Blue
        Wifi may, from time to time, revise at its own discretion and without
        prior notice to the customer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>5. EMAIL USE</h2>{' '}
      <p>
        5.1. It is explicitly prohibited to send unsolicited bulk mail messages
        (“junk mail” or “spam”)of any kind (commercial advertising, political
        tracts, announcements, etc.). This is strongly objected to by most
        Internet users and the repercussions against the offending party and
        Blue Wifi can often result in disruption of service to other users
        connected to Blue Wifi; forward or propagate chain letters nor malicious
        e-mail; send multiple unsolicited electronic mail messages or
        “mail-bombing” to one or more recipient; sending bulk electronic
        messages without identifying, within the message, a reasonable means of
        opting out from receiving additional messages from the sender; using
        redirect links in unsolicited commercial e-mail to advertise a website
        or service; 5.2. Maintaining of mailing lists by users of Blue Wifi is
        accepted only with the permission and approval of the list members, and
        at the members’ sole discretion. Should mailing lists contain invalid or
        undeliverable addresses or addresses of unwilling recipients those
        addresses must be promptly removed. 5.3. Public relay occurs when a mail
        server is accessed by a third party from another domain and utilised to
        deliver mails, without the authority or consent of the owner of the
        mail-server. Users’ mail servers must be secure against public relay as
        a protection to both themselves and the Internet at large. Mail servers
        that are unsecured against public relay often become abused by
        unscrupulous operators for spam delivery and upon detection such
        delivery must be disallowed. Blue Wifi reserves the right to examine
        users’ mail servers to confirm that no mails are being sent from the
        mail server through public relay and the results of such checks can be
        made available to the user. Blue Wifi also reserves the right to examine
        the mail servers of any users using Blue Wifi mail servers for
        “smarthosting” (when the user relays its mail off a Blue Wifi mail
        server to a mail server of its own) or similar services at any time to
        ensure that the servers are properly secured against public relay. All
        relay checks will be done in strict accordance with Blue Wifi’s policy
        of preserving customer privacy.
      </p>

      <h2>6. COMPLAINTS</h2>
      <p>
        6.1. Upon receipt of a complaint, or having become aware of an incident,
        Blue Wifi reserves the right to: 6.1.1. Inform the user’s network
        administrator of the incident and require the network administrator or
        network owner to deal with the incident according to this AUP. 6.1.2. In
        the case of individual users suspend the user’s account and withdraw the
        user’s network access privileges completely. 6.1.3. Charge the offending
        parties for administrative costs as well as for machine and human time
        lost due to the incident. 6.1.4. In severe cases suspend access of the
        user’s entire network until abuse can be prevented by appropriate means.
        6.1.5. Share information concerning the incident with other Internet
        access providers, or publish the information, and/or make available the
        users’ details to law enforcement agencies. Any one or more of the steps
        listed above, insofar as they are deemed necessary by Blue Wifi in its
        absolute and sole discretion, may be taken by Blue Wifi against the
        offending party.
